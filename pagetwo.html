    <h1>Whitewater River rafting 2</h1>
    <p>White Water Rafting, also still referred to by old timers as “River Running”, is a popular recreational activity where a craft (typically a rubber raft) made for navigating whitewater rapids is navigated through white water rapids for the sheer recreational joy of it. That purely recreational purpose is what defines white water rafting. Every summer many thousands venture downriver on rafts for multiple days and nights, camping along the way. Many thousands more participate in day trips, or half-day trips where available.

        The freedom and joy Mark Twain describes his fictional characters Jim and Huckleberry Finn feeling as they rafted down the great Mississippi River, which was essentially a flat water float trip, approaches the feeling of white water rafting. But for all their adventure, Jim and Huck did no white water rafting! Navigation by river for scientific, exploratory, or even hunting and fishing purposes has been around since ancient times. But the recreational purpose for which a raft is taken down the river is what white water rafting is all about! Today, there are hundreds of river outfitters ready to take you white water rafting - one of the best outdoor experiences available on the planet!</p>
